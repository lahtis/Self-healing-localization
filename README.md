# Self‑Healing Localization Layer
### Automatic, self‑maintaining localization for any Python project  
**Author:** Tuomas Lähteenmäki  
**License:** MIT  
**Version:** 0.1.1

## 🌍 Overview

Self‑Healing Localization Layer (SHLL) is a lightweight, dependency‑free Python library that eliminates missing translations forever.

It provides:

- automatic creation of missing language files  
- automatic creation of missing keys  
- fallback to a base language (default: English)  
- unified support for both UI text and AI prompt templates  
- optional AI‑powered translation (planned for v0.2)  

This library is designed to be **dropped into any project** — from small scripts to full applications — and it will maintain localization files automatically as the project grows.

No more manual JSON editing.  
No more “missing translation” errors.  
No more incomplete language packs.

## ✨ Key Features

### ✔ Self‑healing UI localization  
- Missing language files are created automatically  
- Missing keys are added on the fly  
- Base language is used as fallback  

### ✔ Self‑healing AI prompt template localization  
- Missing template files are generated automatically  
- Base templates are copied as fallback  
- Missing template keys are added automatically  

### ✔ Unified high‑level engine  
The `LocalizationEngine` ties everything together:

- ensures languages exist  
- synchronizes all languages with the base language  
- provides clean access to UI text and templates  

### ✔ Zero dependencies  
Pure Python. Works everywhere.

## 📦 Installation

(PyPI release planned for v0.2)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lahtis/Self-healing-localization
```

Import the engine:

```python
from shl.engine import LocalizationEngine
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the engine

```python
from shl.engine import LocalizationEngine

engine = LocalizationEngine(lang_code="fi")  # Finnish
```

### 2. Retrieve UI text

```python
title = engine.ui_text("app_title", "My Application")
```

If `"app_title"` does not exist in `locales/lang_fi.json`, it will be added automatically.

### 3. Retrieve prompt templates

```python
summary_prompt = engine.template("summary_short", "Summarize the text:")
```

If `prompts/fi.json` does not exist, it will be created automatically using `prompts/en.json` as the base.
